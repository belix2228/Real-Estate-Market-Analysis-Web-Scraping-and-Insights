## Introduction

Makaan is a popular real estate website that lists properties for sale and rent across various locations. Web scraping allows us to automatically gather data from the website, which can be useful for market research, analysis, or other real estate-related purposes.

This project uses Python and several libraries to perform web scraping. The primary library used for web scraping is `BeautifulSoup`, a powerful library for extracting information from HTML and XML documents. Additionally, we use the `requests` library to fetch the website's content.
